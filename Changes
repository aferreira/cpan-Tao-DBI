Revision history for Perl extension Tao-DBI.

0.00007  Mon Nov 4 2006
        - this immature code was promoted to a non-development version
        - expression @{%$href}{@idx} used in Tao::DBI::st corrected to
          @{$href}{@idx}
        - I am suspicious some DBD::SQLite versions raised an error
          when preparing statements with invalid SQL, so
          RaiseError => 0 is explicit now in t/007bad.t

        - Tao::DBI::st::initialize() now returns the newly 
          created statement (or not)
        - FIX: prepare() and Tao::DBI::st::new() return undef
          if raw DBI::prepare() returned undef
        - FIX: ':' followed by /[^\w]/ should be literally 
          interpreted, but instead was leaving the SQL with
          translated ? placeholders incomplete
        - the default DBI attribute FetchHashKeyName for Tao
          connections is now 'NAME_lc' - it still misses
          integration with Tao::DBI::st in execute()
        - added new tests "t/007bad.t", "t/008edges.t", "t/009uc_key.t"
